Hello
Are you Canadian?
Where are you coming from?
Glad to meet you
I don’t understand English well
Please speak more slowly
Can you repeat?
What is this called in English?
What does this word mean?
Can I help you?
Hey, how’s it going?
It’s been so long
How do you do?
What’s up?
Wait a minute
Come with me
I know it
I have forgotten
I don’t think so
I am afraid
